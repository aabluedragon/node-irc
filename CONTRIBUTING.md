Hi there! Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for all matrix.org bridge
projects.

This project was forked from [node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc), and is used to power our [IRC bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc).

## node-irc Guidelines

 - Unless your bug is very specific to the IRC client implementation, you should submit bugs to [matrix-appservice-irc](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc).
   If you are uncertain, do not file them in this repository.
 - The official IRC bridge support/development room is [#irc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#irc:matrix.org)
